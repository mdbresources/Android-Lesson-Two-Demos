# Android Lesson Two Demos
The demos presented in lesson two of the MDB android training program.

(1) Notebook - This is a continuation of the notebook demo from the previous demo. Now there is a RecyclerView to allow for multiple notes. There is also a demo of Fragments used for switching between a simple stats tab and the recycler view. There is some json occuring in the backend, managed in the FileUtils class. The FileUtils class, except for the JSON, is not the main point of the demo and may or may not reprsent best practice. FileUtils is a collection of static methods to mange the notes and the necessary files.
